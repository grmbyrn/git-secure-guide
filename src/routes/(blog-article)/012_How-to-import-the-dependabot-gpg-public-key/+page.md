# How to import the dependabot GPG public-key

THe GitHub [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) is a _GitHub dependency management tool that allows you to manage your dependencies in a way that is easy to use and easy to understand_.

The dependabot checks your dependencies regularly and if it finds any new dependencies it will automatically add them to your repository. This is a great way to keep your dependencies up to date and secure. The dependabot is a _GitHub app_ that runs on your GitHub repository. It creates a new pull request to update your dependencies.

It updates not only you language dependencies but also the action you use in your workflows.

A commit from the dependabot looks like this:

```s
git show --show-signature  1ae99046a1e9da0de09cf02ec383a9433acf0665
commit 1ae99046a1e9da0de09cf02ec383a9433acf0665
gpg: Signature made mar 07 jun 2022 01:35:52 WEST

    updated-dependencies:
    - dependency-name: actions/setup-node
      dependency-type: direct:production
      update-type: version-update:semver-minor
    ...

    Signed-off-by: dependabot[bot] <support@github.com>
```

As you can see in the line `gpg: Can't check signature: No public key`, this is a _GPG error_ that means that the dependabot's public GPG key is not installed on your machine.

You can import the public key by executing this command:

```s
curl https://github.com/web-flow.gpg | gpg --import
gpg -k 4AEE18F83AFDEB23
```

If you run the previous command again you will see the following output:

```s
git show --show-signature  1ae99046a1e9da0de09cf02ec383a9433acf0665
commit 1ae99046a1e9da0de09cf02ec383a9433acf0665
gpg: Signature made mar 07 jun 2022 01:35:52 WEST
gpg:                using RSA key 4AEE18F83AFDEB23
gpg: Good signature from "GitHub (web-flow commit signing) <noreply@github.com>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

...
```

This time you see this message: `gpg: Good signature from "GitHub (web-flow commit signing) ...`

In order to remove that message you have to trust that key.

```s
$ gpg --edit-key 5DE3E0509C47EA3CF04A42D34AEE18F83AFDEB23

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

Please note that the shown key validity is not necessarily correct
unless you restart the program.

gpg> quit
```

Finally, if you show the commit signature again you will see:

```s
$ git show --show-signature  1ae99046a1e9da0de09cf02ec383a9433acf0665
