Here we attempt to help any developer to use GIT and GitHub more securely.
Any challenges that we are facing in terms of security will be registered here.
You will find information on how to use GIT securely in development work.
This guide is the result of our team actively developing a pure GIT / GitHub infrastructure for repository optimization and automation during which we encountered security challenges.

This is a website based on a WIP repository where we will be adding new things as we keep developing. The contents takes two forms: articles and lists of resources.

Topics that are covered among others:

- GPG and how we use it for projects.
- GPG basic and more advanced uses in relation to GIT and GitHub.
- GitHub secrets, tokens, etc.
- GIT vs GitHub differences.
- etc.
